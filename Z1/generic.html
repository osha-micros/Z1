                <h2>What is world hunger relief?</h2>
                <h3>What is world hunger relief?</h3>
                <h4>Started in 2007 as world hunger relief week, Yum! and its brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell) created world hunger relief to highlight and drive action on the movement to end world hunger by increasing awareness, raising money for United Nations world food programme (WFP) and other hunger relief volunteerism.</h4>
                <p>
                    Since World Hunger Relief launched in 2007, more than one million of the Company’s employees, franchisees and their families have volunteered more than 21 million hours to aid hunger relief efforts in communities worldwide. The effort has raised nearly $85 million for WFP and other hunger relief organizations and is helping to provide over 350 million meals and save the lives of millions of people in remote corners of the world. In January 2010, Yum! Brands was honored to be named WFP’s Partner of the Year at the World Economic Forum annual meeting at Davos. Additionally, PR Week awarded World Hunger Relief with top honours as the “Cause–Related Campaign of the Year 2010”.
